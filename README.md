# CICD Pipeline with GitHub Actions and AWS

This project demonstrates the setup of a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and AWS services.

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes for a web application hosted on AWS.

### Prerequisites

- AWS account
- GitHub repository with the web application source code

### Project Structure

- `.github/workflows/`: Directory containing the GitHub Actions workflow files.
- `src/`: Directory containing the source code of the web application.

## Pipeline Workflow

The CI/CD pipeline is configured using GitHub Actions. It consists of the following stages:

1. **Build**: Compiles the source code and packages the application artifacts.
2. **Test**: Runs tests to ensure the application functions as expected.
3. **Deploy**: Deploys the application to AWS services, such as Amazon S3 and AWS Lambda.

### Workflow Configuration

The workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file. The workflow includes the following steps:

1. Checkout code from the repository.
2. Set up the required environment (e.g., Node.js, AWS CLI).
3. Build the application.
4. Run tests.
5. Deploy the application to AWS.

## Usage

To set up the CI/CD pipeline for your web application, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Modify the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file to customize the pipeline stages and deployment steps.
3. Update the application source code in the `src/` directory.
4. Configure your AWS credentials in the GitHub repository secrets.
5. Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.
6. GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the pipeline when changes are pushed.

## AWS Configuration

To support the CI/CD pipeline, you need to set up the following AWS resources:

- **Amazon S3**: Create an S3 bucket to store the application artifacts.
- **AWS Lambda**: Set up a Lambda function to run serverless code.
- **AWS IAM**: Configure an IAM role with appropriate permissions for the pipeline.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the pipeline setup or execution, refer to the [Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/your-username/CICD-Pipeline-with-GitHub-Actions-and-AWS/wiki/Troubleshooting) or create a new issue in the GitHub repository.
